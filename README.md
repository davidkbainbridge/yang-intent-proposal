OpenDaylight Intent Yang Model Proposal
---

This project represents a proposal for a Yang model that defines a purposefully simplistic intent model. By providing
a simplistic model it allows the community as a whole to experiment and grow the model when the community runs into
pain points. 

Request Model
---
As a side effect of the intent model a simple request model was included as well. This model represents a simplistic
model of how a request based capability might be added on top of MD-SAL allowing ODL to support an interaction model
where a client submits an asynchronous request and is able to asynchronous monitor is status until completion.
